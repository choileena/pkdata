Description: Prepare Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data for PK/PD analyses. 
    The `pkdata` package provides functions to creat PK/PD data to perform diverse 
    PK/PD analyses. Especially, the package includes functions that creates PK/PD data 
    from raw data extracted from Electronic Health Record (EHR), which can be used 
    in several modules to perform PK/PD studies, as outlined in Choi et al. (2020). 
    Additional functions will be added in future.
